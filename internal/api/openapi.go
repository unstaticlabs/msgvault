// APISchemaVersion is the version stamped into the OpenAPI document
// (info.version). It tracks the HTTP wire contract, not the binary build
// version, so clients can reason about compatibility independently of releases.
//
// 1.1.0: GET /api/v1/cli/search no longer blocks on the FTS completeness
// probe/backfill; it returns immediately and reports background index work in
// the additive index_state field ("checking"/"building"). Clients older than
// this field ignore it and see results without a completeness caveat during
// that window — the same exposure GET /api/v1/search has always had. Additive
// (minor bump): the major-version compatibility gate stays at 1.
//
// 1.2.0: adds the deletion staging endpoints — POST /api/v1/deletions
// (server-side Gmail-ID resolution, dry-run preview), GET /api/v1/deletions
// (list staged manifests by status), and DELETE /api/v1/deletions/{id}
// (cancel a pending/in-progress manifest). Additive (minor bump): the
// major-version compatibility gate stays at 1.
//
// 1.3.0: GET /api/v1/search/deep accepts the additive scope=body parameter
// and echoes that scope in successful body-only responses. Those responses
// carry ID-keyed body_contexts selected by the active FTS backend while the
// existing messages element schema remains stable. Omitted scope keeps the
// existing composite search contract.
// Additive (minor bump): the major-version compatibility gate stays at 1.
//
// 1.4.0: vector/hybrid search adds offset pagination, has_more, and opt-in
// scored chunk matches. Additive (minor bump): existing summary-only callers
// retain their request and response behavior.
//
// 1.5.0 adds source IDs to message summaries, source filters and capability
// echoes to fast search, and the search_scope/source filters plus capability
// echoes to total statistics. The echoes let remote clients fail closed when
// a released older daemon ignores an additive request filter.
// Additive (minor bump): the major-version compatibility gate stays at 1.
//
// 1.6.0 adds the browser-session login, bootstrap, and logout routes. Existing
// API-key security remains the documented scheme for protected API routes;
// cookie authentication is an additive same-origin browser mechanism.
// 1.7.0 adds optimistic, secret-redacting browser settings reads and writes.
//
// 1.8.0 adds daemon-owned shared Saved View CRUD with schema-versioned
// canonical definitions and revision ETags.
//
// 1.9.0 adds finite analytical exploration, grouping, selection preflight,
// visible-row lexical match counts, and bounded attachment-fact operations.
//
// 1.10.0 adds filtered semantic-index coverage and explicit coverage states.
//
// 1.11.0 adds attachment-accurate analytical grouping for the Files workspace.
// 1.13.0 adds contextual People and Domain summaries with search authority.
// 1.14.0 adds path-scoped People and Domain file search routes. Their identity
// scope is server-owned narrowing applied after canonical search resolution.
// 1.15.0 adds deletion-manifest detail, exact reviewed-selection deletion
// staging, and server-owned source-sync and selection-action capabilities.
// 1.16.0 adds exact server-authorized browser action targets and truthful
// nullable source-run status fields.
// 1.18.0 makes task mutations retry-stable, adds configured-project task
// search and explicit outbound metadata disclosure, and expands cache states.
// 1.19.0 adds POST /api/v1/relationships: reciprocity-weighted, time-decayed
// ranking of counterparts over resolved identity clusters, with an
// identity_revision cursor authority alongside the existing cache revision.
// 1.20.0 adds POST /api/v1/relationships/{id}/timeline: one counterpart's
// modality-neutral interaction timeline, with chat messages grouped into
// local-day bursts. {id} accepts any member of the counterpart's identity
// cluster and the response echoes the resolved canonical_id.
// 1.21.0 adds POST /api/v1/identity/links and POST /api/v1/identity/unlinks:
// idempotent participant-link mutations that report the new identity
// revision and whether the synchronous Parquet identity-dataset refresh that
// follows succeeded (cache_state: ready|stale). Also adds the additive
// cache_state field to the existing CLI identity add/remove responses.
// 1.22.0 adds optional start/end (RFC3339, UTC, half-open [start, end)) query
// params to GET /api/v1/conversations/{id}. When present, the window and the
// before/after counts are scoped to the range; an anchor outside the range is
// a 400 (conversation_anchor_outside_range) rather than the default full-
// conversation window. Additive (minor bump): omitting the params preserves
// the existing full-conversation behavior.
// 1.23.0 makes GET /api/v1/people/{id} (the analytical participant detail,
// /api/v1/participants/{id} since 2.0.0) cluster-aware: PersonIdentifier adds
// participant_id, and PersonSummary adds an additive cluster field
// (canonical_id, member_ids, edges) populated only when the requested
// participant is linked to at least one other participant. Identifiers on a
// linked participant's detail span every cluster member instead of just the
// requested ID. Additive (minor bump): unlinked participants and existing
// callers that ignore the new fields see no behavior change.
// 1.24.0 adds the additive counterpart_participant_id field to EntryRow: the
// smallest participant ID on the entry that is not the archive owner, with
// owners resolved through the same cluster-aware canon Relationships ranking
// uses. It is omitted/null when the owner set is unknown (no
// owner_participants rows) or every participant on the entry is the owner.
// Additive (minor bump): existing callers that ignore the field see no
// behavior change.
// 1.25.0 adds the entry_key field to FileMetadataResponse: the canonical
// explore entry key of the attachment's containing item, built with the same
// chat/message classification the explore listings render, so file deep
// links can select a listed entry exactly. Additive (minor bump): existing
// callers that ignore the field see no behavior change.
// 1.26.0 adds the search_deletion_scope field to explore, groups, and
// preflight responses: semantic and hybrid searches declare that an
// unrestricted deletion context was narrowed to active messages (vector
// indexes cover only live rows). Additive (minor bump): existing callers
// that ignore the field see no behavior change.
// 1.27.0 bounds GET /api/v1/conversations/{id} responses: inline message
// bodies are capped by a cumulative uncompressed-body budget (the anchor's
// body is always inlined). Messages beyond the budget carry the additive
// body_omitted flag with empty body fields and an intact snippet; clients
// fetch those bodies individually via GET /api/v1/messages/{id}. The
// store-backed single-message path now also returns body_html. Additive
// (minor bump): typical threads still inline every body, and existing
// callers that ignore the flag see empty bodies only on threads that would
// previously have produced unbounded responses.
// 1.28.0 adds the additive read_only field to Setting: settings marked
// read_only (currently vector.embeddings.api_key_env) are visible over HTTP
// but can only be changed by editing config.toml on the daemon host, and
// PATCH /api/v1/settings continues to reject updates to them. Clients use
// the flag to render such settings as non-editable and exclude them from
// atomic updates. Additive (minor bump): existing callers that ignore the
// field see no behavior change.
// 1.29.0 adds GET /api/v1/content/remote-image: an SSRF-hardened proxy the
// browser uses to load consented remote mail images. The daemon validates
// the URL (http/https, no credentials, hostname gate), rejects private or
// reserved destinations, resolves DNS itself and validates every answer,
// dials only the validated address (re-validating each bounded redirect
// hop), and enforces an image/* content type and a 10 MiB body cap. The
// browser therefore never contacts sender-controlled hosts directly.
// Additive (minor bump): the major-version compatibility gate stays at 1.
// 1.30.0 changes /api/v1/content/remote-image from GET (url query parameter)
// to POST with a required JSON body {"url": "..."}. POST makes the proxy an
// unsafe method for browsers, so the session CSRF machinery (same-origin
// Origin check plus X-Csrf-Token) applies and a sibling-origin <img> embed
// can no longer trigger authenticated outbound fetches. The response
// (image bytes) is unchanged. The endpoint shipped in 1.29.0 and had no
// released non-browser consumers, so this replaces the GET form outright.
// 1.31.0 adds the optional group_key field to POST /api/v1/explore/groups:
// when set, the response contains only the group whose key equals it exactly
// (any rank), and total_count reports the matched-row count (0 or 1). Clients
// use it to hydrate a selected group without paging the ranked listing.
// Additive (minor bump): omitting the field preserves the ranked listing.
// 1.32.0 adds durable person profiles: promote an observed participant
// cluster (201 on creation, 200 on idempotent re-promotion), list/get stable
// profiles, update the display-name override and delete a profile with
// revision-tag optimistic concurrency, and surface the covering profile on
// the /people/{id} analytical detail (/participants/{id} since 2.0.0).
// 1.33.0 adds provider-neutral single-meeting ingestion with strict request
// schemas and idempotent create/update responses.
// 1.34.0 adds GET /api/v1/messages/changes: a keyset feed over the
// content_changed_at watermark that lets a consumer re-read the messages whose
// content changed since its last poll, including hidden and source-deleted
// rows. Position is carried by an opaque cursor a client stores and sends back;
// timestamps in the page are serialised with full sub-second precision. An
// empty page echoes the requested cursor so an idle consumer holds its place,
// except that a cursor above the server clock is clamped down to the commit
// bound, or echoed unchanged if the server has not yet established one. The
// cursor is bound to the archive that issued it: an unreadable token, one from a
// cursor format this build does not speak, and one issued against a different
// archive are each rejected with 400 invalid_cursor rather than read as the
// beginning of the archive. It is not signed, so a well-formed cursor naming
// this archive is accepted whoever built it. Stores that cannot answer the
// watermark query, or cannot identify their archive, report 503
// feature_unavailable. Additive (minor bump): a new path only.
// 1.35.0 adds the portable attribute registry and typed person attributes:
// attribute-definition list/get/create/patch/delete with ETag/If-Match
// optimistic concurrency, and person attribute list/set/clear with
// value-level provenance, retained history, and dry-run previews.
// Additive (minor bump): the major-version compatibility gate stays at 1.
// 1.36.0 resolves source-scoped identity filters on relationship ranking and
// timeline routes, and adds a typed terminal error variant to CLI identity
// discovery NDJSON streams. Additive (minor bump): existing progress/result
// events and relationship requests without identity filters are unchanged.
// 1.37.0 adds typed structured-person profile read, patch, and history routes,
// plus an open communication-service catalog. Additive (minor bump): existing
// person and source-identity routes keep their current contracts.
// 1.38.0 adds authenticated raw access to inline person-profile media bytes.
// Additive (minor bump): existing profile metadata and patch contracts are
// unchanged, and URI-only media remains metadata-only.
// 1.39.0 adds typed temporal person relationships: relationship-type CRUD,
// one canonical edge with endpoint-aware presentation, optimistic PATCH and
// delete operations, and unresolved RELATED review listing. Additive (minor
// bump): existing endpoints and response fields are unchanged.
// 1.40.0 adds organization profiles, employment history, and their typed
// attribute, projection, and lifecycle routes.
// 1.41.0 adds list, accept, and reject routes for reviewable identity match
// candidates. Additive (minor bump): existing person, source-identity, and
// meeting-import routes keep their current contracts.
// 1.42.0 adds the dated activity and daily-note route families. Existing
// profile, meeting, media, and other API contracts remain unchanged.
// 1.43.0 adds structured analytical-cache readiness responses, including the
// transient building state, to cache-dependent coverage and detail routes.
// Additive (minor bump): existing success responses remain unchanged.
// 1.44.0 adds dedicated extracted-document search and status routes. Additive
// (minor bump): existing message, file, profile, media, and activity routes are
// unchanged.
// 2.0.0 separates observed participant analytics under /participants from
// durable curated people under /people and removes the ambiguous old routes.
// 2.1.0 adds portable attribute sensitivity metadata and per-person tracking,
// and reports this version as api_schema_version on authenticated
// /api/v1/health so remote CLI clients can verify compatibility on connect.
// 2.2.0 adds participant-scoped file search responses and direction controls.
// Additive (minor bump): the archive-wide file routes are unchanged.
// 2.3.0 bounds organization profile replacements to 200 structured values and
// 32 MiB of logical inline media, and documents the resulting 413 response.
// 2.4.0 adds exact source selection to CLI sync and deletion transports. CLI
// clients check this version before asking a daemon to perform a scoped sync.
// 2.5.0 adds durable-person attachment retrieval across metadata, document,
// and visual lanes while keeping participant references compatible.
// 2.6.0 adds protected semantic search over durable curated people. Ranked
// results contain only the durable person root and semantic score; person
// projection text and raw profile details remain internal.
// Additive (minor bump): existing person and participant routes are unchanged.
// 2.7.0 adds exact structured sender, recipient, domain, label, source, date,
// time-period, and attachment filters to vector and hybrid search. Stats also
// report the text-vector message-type scope for compatible search clients.
// Additive (minor bump): existing unfiltered searches are unchanged.
// 2.8.0 adds CardDAV account setup, book roles, publication, conflict, and
// sync routes. Passwords are request-only and never appear in responses.
// 2.9.0 adds reversible person merge/split mutations, merge history, snapshot
// inspection, and merge-candidate decisions. Mutations require strong person
// revision tags; merge and split also require retry-stable Idempotency-Key
// headers.
// 2.10.0 adds graph-relative relationship temperatures to participant summaries
// and a timezone-aware person/year relationship calendar endpoint.
// Additive (minor bump): existing relationship and participant routes retain
// their request and response behavior.
// 2.11.0 adds bounded person fact catalog, evidence, evidence-status, claim,
// decision, and pin diagnostics plus direct pin replacement. It adds no
// candidate, review, accept, or reject workflow.
// Additive (minor bump): existing person, participant, relationship, calendar,
// and CardDAV routes are unchanged.
// 2.12.0 adds deletion_scope=active|deleted|any to GET /api/v1/cli/search.
// Omission preserves the active-only default. Additive (minor bump): existing
// clients continue to receive the same result population.
// 2.13.0 makes deduplicate planning use an explicit, version-gated backfill
// confirmation protocol. It also adds GET /api/v1/people/directory: a paginated,
// lexical, non-sensitive Directory view of promoted durable people. The legacy
// unpaginated GET /api/v1/people response remains unchanged.
// 2.14.0 adds exact case-insensitive List-ID filtering to analytics, deletion,
// and vector/hybrid search MessageFilter routes, and includes nullable list_id
// values in the message change feed. Remote clients must require this version
// before sending list_id because older compatible daemons ignore unknown query
// parameters and could widen a scoped request. It also adds the person network,
// operation history, CardDAV status and run-history reads, the self-describing
// Settings catalog, stable-name person enrichment provider updates, and
// write-only provider credential endpoints. It replaces the CardDAV publication
// and conflict response shapes with bounded projections that omit raw vCards and
// resource hrefs so those responses cannot expose private contact data or
// infrastructure identifiers. That shape change lands inside the unreleased 2.x
// line: nothing after the released 1.36.0 contract has shipped yet, so it does
// not open a new major version.
// Existing filtered target requests are unchanged.
// 2.15.0 adds POST /api/v1/cli/repair-message with a dedicated request and
// streaming event contract for Gmail snapshot repair and audit operations.
// Additive (minor bump): existing CLI routes and clients remain unchanged.
// 2.16.0 adds complete MessageFilter parameters to total statistics and adds
// result totals and statistics to deep search. Search-aware deletion query
// parameters introduced with these TUI contracts are also covered by 2.16.0.
// It also adds authenticated asynchronous historical import jobs at
// POST /api/v1/imports and GET /api/v1/imports/{job_id}. Existing synchronous
// CLI sync routes and source-status responses are unchanged.
// 2.17.0 adds repeated/comma-separated source_ids to aggregate and message
// filter routes, plus applied_source_ids echoes. Clients can therefore fail
// closed when an older daemon ignores an additive source scope instead of
// widening the result to all sources. Text search also accepts source_id
// and confirms it with applied_source_id.
// 2.18.0 adds deletable_count to selection preflight and matched/skipped
// counts to deletion staging. Query staging accepts the deletable subset of
// mixed selections; clients can disclose that subset before confirmation.
// 2.19.0 extends operation history with durable invocation lanes, date bounds,
// filter-bound pagination, fixed error codes, supported actions, and related
// status identifiers. It adds GET /api/v1/documents/status/current to resolve
// status for the selected durable document profile. These Operations response
// changes remain within the unreleased 2.x contract.
// 2.21.0 adds the calling principal to the session bootstrap, the
// login_methods list, GET /api/v1/me, and 403 forbidden for callers whose
// role does not cover an operation. This shipped in this repository as 2.17.0
// before the fork caught up with upstream, which had independently used that
// number for source scoping; a daemon reporting 2.17.0 may therefore be either.
// Clients that need to distinguish them should treat >= 2.21.0 as the reliable
// signal for the principal fields.
// 2.22.0 adds POST /api/v1/inbox-archive/authorize and
// POST /api/v1/inbox-archive/execute, which remove messages from the inbox at
// the mail provider. Both refuse unless the daemon opts in with
// [inbox_archive] remote_enabled or MSGVAULT_INBOX_ARCHIVE_REMOTE_ENABLED, so a
// client that finds the routes present still cannot assume the capability is
// available. A run that stopped part-way answers 200 with its counts and
// partial_failure rather than an error, because the messages it archived stay
// archived. The routes were briefly reserved at 2.20.0 while the fork was
// catching up with upstream; they take a number above the auth work instead,
// because 2.21.0 shipped without them and >= 2.20.0 would otherwise claim them
// on a daemon that has none.
