// pgWatermarkBoundsQuery reads the change feed's clock and commit bound in one
// round trip.
//
// The bound is the oldest transaction start among the backends that hold a
// write lock on THIS database's `messages`, floored by this statement's own
// transaction start. Correctness rests on three facts about PostgreSQL:
//
//   - A statement that modifies rows takes ROW EXCLUSIVE on its target
//     relation, and holds it to end of transaction. It takes it before it
//     touches a row, so before the trigger evaluates clock_timestamp(). Any
//     transaction that has stamped a watermark is therefore in pg_locks here,
//     including one that reached `messages` only through the message_bodies
//     trigger — that trigger's UPDATE locks `messages` too.
//
//   - A backend publishes xact_start into shared memory when its transaction
//     begins, before any statement of that transaction can run. So a row
//     stamped by transaction X at instant S has X's xact_start visible here at
//     every instant after S, and xact_start <= S. Anything that could still
//     commit therefore sits at or above MIN(xact_start), and a page bounded
//     strictly below it cannot skip over it. Autocommit statements are covered:
//     PostgreSQL wraps each in an implicit transaction with its own xact_start.
//
//   - transaction_timestamp() closes the race in the other direction. A
//     transaction that takes the lock AFTER this read cannot appear in it, but
//     it also cannot stamp anything at or below this statement's own start.
//     clock_timestamp() would not do: it advances past the read and would leave
//     a sliver of time uncovered.
//
// The lock scope is what keeps the bound from being a database-wide stall
// signal. Filtering only on "is in a transaction" would let a connection that
// has nothing to do with `messages` — an idle-in-transaction reporting session,
// a batch writing some other table — freeze the feed for everyone. Read locks
// are excluded by mode for the same reason: a long-running SELECT on `messages`
// holds ACCESS SHARE and cannot produce a watermark. So is autovacuum, which
// takes SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE and never rewrites the column. What remains are
// the modes a row write or a table rewrite actually holds.
//
// to_regclass rather than a cast so a database without the table yields NULL
// instead of an error; the COALESCE then degrades to this transaction's start
// rather than to NULL, which the keyset predicate would silently read as "no
// rows". The lock's relation OID is resolved through the session's search_path,
// so the bound is scoped to the schema this connection actually writes.
//
// THE QUERY MUST NOT FAIL OPEN. Every filter above narrows the set of
// transactions that hold the bound back, so a filter that stops matching does
// not raise an error — it silently returns the clock, which is the broken
// bound this whole mechanism exists to replace. Two ways that can happen are
// checked in Go rather than left to the SQL:
//
//   - to_regclass returns NULL if `messages` cannot be resolved on the
//     session's search_path. The query then joins against NULL, matches
//     nothing, and every uncommitted write becomes invisible to the bound. The
//     last two output columns exist so ReadWatermarkBounds can refuse instead.
//
//   - pg_stat_activity REDACTS xact_start, state and backend_type (they read
//     as NULL) for backends belonging to other roles, unless the reading role
//     is a superuser or a member of pg_read_all_stats — verified against
//     PostgreSQL 17. A redacted backend cannot hold the bound back, so a write
//     made by a different role could be lost exactly as it was before this
//     bound existed. The count of redacted backends THAT COULD BE HOLDING A
//     STAMP is returned so the bound can be capped at the last instant every
//     such backend was visible; see visibilityFloor. msgvault connects with one
//     role, so in an ordinary deployment the count is zero and nothing is
//     capped.
//
// The redaction count carries the same lock scope as the bound itself, and for
// the same reason. The two are halves of one partition: every backend in this
// database holding a write lock on `messages` is either visible, in which case
// the bound already accounts for it through its xact_start, or redacted, in
// which case it is counted here. A backend that is in neither set — a pooled
// connection sitting idle, a long SELECT holding ACCESS SHARE, autovacuum doing
// its routine SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE work, a session writing some other table —
// cannot have stamped a watermark on `messages`, so it belongs in neither.
// Counting it anyway (which an unscoped count does) freezes the feed for
// everyone until that backend TERMINATES, which behind a connection pool is
// never; docs/api-server.md promises exactly the opposite.
//
// Each predicate in the count fails in a known direction:
//
//   - a.backend_type IS NULL is the redaction test. If a backend stops looking
//     redacted while its xact_start is still hidden it drops out of both halves
//     and the count fails OPEN. It cannot: the same privilege check nulls all
//     three columns together, so backend_type is visible exactly when
//     xact_start is.
//   - a.datname = current_database() and the l.relation / l.mode scope narrow
//     the count, so each of them fails OPEN if it stops matching. That is why
//     they are the SAME predicates the bound uses rather than a second,
//     independently-drifting spelling: a scope that narrowed here but not there
//     would leave a writer in neither half, which is silent row loss. pg_locks
//     is not redacted for other roles' backends (verified on PostgreSQL 17), so
//     the lock half of the join sees a foreign writer in full.
//   - No l.granted filter. An ungranted lock request cannot have stamped
//     anything yet, so filtering on it would be sound, but omitting it can only
//     over-count, and over-counting fails CLOSED — a visible stall rather than
//     a silent loss.
//
// One residual is known and not covered: a PREPARED transaction holds its locks
// with pg_locks.pid NULL, so the join drops it from both halves. It needs
// max_prepared_transactions > 0, which is off by default and which msgvault
// never uses. What that costs a consumer is written up with the feed's other
// exceptions in docs/api-server.md, rather than restated here.

//     multibyte subject/recipient list from tripping the limit. Any UpsertFTS
//     error is warn-only at the call site — the message still persists with
//     search_fts left NULL.
//   - Backfill path (FTSBackfillBatchSQL): the body lives in the DB, so only
//     the LEFT char cap applies; backfillFTSRowByRow skips the offending row
//     (with a logged warning) and continues, so one pathological row never
//     aborts BackfillFTS or wedges later batches.

// EnsureTriggers creates the maintenance triggers for BOTH message watermarks
// idempotently. The two answer different questions and are deliberately scoped
// differently.
//
// messages.last_modified is a TRUE row-level watermark: blanket by design, it
// moves on ANY change to a message row or its body, because the embed worker
// uses it as an optimistic-CAS token and must not miss a content edit that
// lands between its read and its stamp. Two triggers feed it:
//
//   - trg_messages_last_modified (BEFORE UPDATE on messages): sets
//     NEW.last_modified in-row. BEFORE → no secondary write → no recursion.
//     The WHEN guard (OLD.last_modified IS NOT DISTINCT FROM NEW.last_modified)
//     yields to an explicit last_modified write in the UPDATE rather than
//     overriding it, mirroring the SQLite trigger's guard.
//   - trg_message_bodies_last_modified (AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE on
//     message_bodies): bumps the parent message's last_modified so body
//     edits move the worker's CAS token too.
//
// messages.content_changed_at is the opposite: both COLUMN-scoped and
// VALUE-scoped, so an external consumer maintaining an incremental copy of the
// archive is woken only when the message's own content, routing, or lifecycle
// actually changed — never by bookkeeping such as embed_gen or
// indexing_version. Four triggers feed it here, built from
// MessagesContentColumns so the SQLite and PostgreSQL definitions cannot drift
// (a fresh SQLite database runs three of them — see the first entry):
//
//   - trg_messages_content_changed_ins (BEFORE INSERT on messages): stamps new
//     rows. PostgreSQL's column carries no DEFAULT — neither in schema_pg.sql
//     nor on the ALTER TABLE upgrade path — so on this backend the trigger is
//     the single writer for new rows. SQLite is where that stops being true: a
//     database created from schema.sql gives the column a DEFAULT
//     byte-identical to SQLiteDialect.ContentChangedNow, and EnsureTriggers
//     there detects it (contentChangedAtDefaultStamps) and creates no INSERT
//     trigger at all, because a SQLite trigger cannot assign to NEW and merely
//     having a row trigger on messages costs every INSERT a statement journal.
//     So the single writer for new rows is this trigger on PostgreSQL, the
//     column DEFAULT on a fresh SQLite database, and SQLite's AFTER INSERT
//     trigger of the same name on a SQLite database upgraded by ALTER TABLE ADD
//     COLUMN, which cannot carry a non-constant DEFAULT. The WHEN guard yields
//     to an explicit write in the INSERT in every version.
//   - trg_messages_content_changed_at (BEFORE UPDATE OF <content columns> on
//     messages): UPDATE OF scopes it to the columns a statement NAMES, which
//     is not enough on its own — UpsertMessage's ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
//     re-assigns ten content columns on every re-sync of a known message — so
//     contentChangedValueGuard additionally requires one of them to have
//     actually changed value. IS DISTINCT FROM makes that comparison null-safe
//     in both directions.
//   - trg_message_bodies_content_changed_ins / _upd (AFTER INSERT / AFTER
//     UPDATE on message_bodies): a body edit must reach the parent's
//     watermark. They stay two triggers rather than one AFTER INSERT OR
//     UPDATE because only the UPDATE half can carry a value guard (a WHEN
//     clause on an INSERT trigger cannot reference OLD), and the guard is
//     required: upsertMessageBody always executes its ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE,
//     even when messageBodyChanges reports nothing changed.
//
// CREATE TRIGGER is not idempotent before PG14, so each trigger is dropped
// (IF EXISTS) and recreated; the functions use CREATE OR REPLACE. Re-running
// InitSchema is therefore safe, and DROP + CREATE also lets a later change to
// the content-column list actually reach an already-deployed archive. Runs on
// the querier so InitSchema can route it through the maintenance transaction
// (consistent with EnsureFTSIndex).
