All notable changes to msgvault, grouped by release.

## Unreleased

**Breaking changes**

- The HTTP API separates observed participant analytics from durable curated
  people, crossing the API schema 2.0 compatibility boundary at 2.1.0. The
  current unreleased API schema is 2.17.0. Version 2.14.0 also replaces the CardDAV
  publication and conflict response shapes with bounded projections that
  omit raw vCards and resource hrefs. The
  analytical routes formerly under `/api/v1/people/*` (search, detail,
  summary, timeline, files) now live under `/api/v1/participants/*`, and the
  durable person routes formerly under `/api/v1/persons/*` now live under
  `/api/v1/people/*`. The old paths are removed, not aliased: `/api/v1/people`
  changed meaning, so an alias would silently serve differently shaped data.
  The CLI and daemon refuse to interoperate across the 1.x/2.x schema
  boundary with a clear error — upgrade both together. This covers configured
  remotes too: the daemon reports `api_schema_version` on authenticated
  `/api/v1/health`, and a CLI in remote mode verifies it on connect,
  rejecting daemons that predate schema 2.0.

- Deletion staging now requires every selected message to belong to one exact
  source. TUI and MCP selections that span accounts are rejected instead of
  creating a manifest that could mark or delete the wrong account's messages.
  In the TUI, press `a` to filter by account before staging again; MCP callers
  should pass `account` or stage each source separately.

**Features**

- Roles and named API keys. `[[auth.api_keys]]` entries carry a `viewer`,
  `member`, or `admin` role while `[server].api_key` stays the administrator.
  The daemon answers `403 forbidden` for operations a role does not cover,
  reports the caller on `GET /api/v1/me` and in the session bootstrap, and the
  Web UI shows who is signed in with a sign-out control. `msgvault mcp --http`
  accepts named keys and exposes each caller only the tools its role permits.
  `[auth] api_key_login = false` hides the API-key login form. API schema
  2.17.0.

- Single sign-on. `[auth.oidc]` signs people in through an OpenID Connect
  provider (authorization code with PKCE) and maps the provider's groups to
  roles; the Web UI offers "Sign in with <provider>". The same provider's
  access tokens authenticate API requests and `msgvault mcp --http`, which now
  publishes RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata so Claude Code and claude.ai
  connectors sign in through the provider; tokens need the `msgvault:read`
  scope and `msgvault:write` for mutations, and clients are asked for both
  alongside the identity scopes. Sign-ins are recorded in new
  `users` and `user_identities` tables. `[auth.oidc]`, `[auth] api_key_login`,
  and `[server] trusted_proxies` accept environment overrides
  (`MSGVAULT_AUTH_OIDC_*`, `MSGVAULT_AUTH_API_KEY_LOGIN`,
  `MSGVAULT_SERVER_TRUSTED_PROXIES`) for container deployments, which can
  also declare named keys with `MSGVAULT_AUTH_API_KEYS` (a JSON array of the
  same entries) and `[remote]` with `MSGVAULT_REMOTE_URL`,
  `MSGVAULT_REMOTE_API_KEY`, and `MSGVAULT_REMOTE_ALLOW_INSECURE`.

- Per-user visible sources. Administrators bind sources to users
  (`msgvault user`, Settings → Users, `GET/PUT/PATCH /api/v1/users…`), and
  every non-administrator — a signed-in person, a key bound to a `user`, or a
  token — sees only those sources across search, Explore, aggregates, message
  detail, text views, documents, visual search, source status, and the MCP
  tools. The people graph, attachment blobs, and Saved View definitions stay
  shared by design; `POST /api/v1/query` stays administrator-only. The MCP
  listener forwards the caller in `X-Msgvault-On-Behalf-Of`, which the daemon
  honours from admin keys marked `on_behalf_of`. New `user_sources` table.

- MCP users are created on first use. `msgvault mcp --http` forwards the
  identity it verified through the provider (`X-Msgvault-On-Behalf-Of-Identity`:
  provider account, display name, and the role derived from the groups) beside
  `X-Msgvault-On-Behalf-Of`, and the daemon records it as a sign-in from admin
  keys marked `on_behalf_of`, so a person connecting from Claude no longer has
  to open the Web UI first. When the daemon still refuses the person — an
  older daemon, a key without `on_behalf_of`, or a disabled user — tool calls
  answer an `acting_user_refused` error that asks for one web sign-in instead
  of a generic internal error. A disabled user acting through the sidecar is
  now refused whatever their role.

- Web Directory workspace: browse and search promoted durable people, filter
  by contact state, category, organization, and last contact, and maintain a
  person's profile, custom fields, employment, typed relationships, tracking,
  CardDAV publication, and merge history in place. Identity-match and
  imported-relationship review queues, explicit merge and split, and a
  bounded person network (`GET /api/v1/people/{id}/network`) built only
  from curated relationships and employments live in the same shell.

- Settings workspace in the Web UI and a keyboard-only Settings screen in
  the TUI (`,`), driven by a daemon-described catalog with restart-pending
  state. Provider API keys are stored write-only in
  `tokens/provider-credentials.json` and can be added, replaced, or removed
  without revealing their values; named Exa and SixtyFour person-enrichment
  policies, text and visual embedding configuration, and future-only
  attachment download rules are editable from the browser.

- Operation history: `GET /api/v1/operations/runs` and `/operations/status`
  expose normalized sync, person-sweep, and CardDAV run history with stable
  cursors, and CardDAV sync runs are recorded and recoverable after a
  daemon restart.

- Chat media collection now skips attachments from conversations with more
  than 20 participants by default on Beeper, Slack, Discord, and Teams. Direct
  chats and small groups keep their media; skipped occurrences carry a typed
  `participant_threshold` marker instead of a retry marker. Set
  `media_max_participants = 0` in the provider table to remove the cap, or
  raise it to taste. With large-room volume gone, the per-attachment size
  default for Beeper, Slack, and Teams moves from 100 MiB to 250 MiB so long
  voice notes, screen recordings, and phone video from direct chats are kept;
  Discord stays at 50 MiB, and an explicit `max_media_mb` is unchanged.
  Previously over-cap files under 250 MiB are retried by the next
  `backfill-*-media` run because the cap changed. The `media_scope`,
  `media_max_participants`, `max_media_mb`, and `accounts_config` keys are now
  documented for every chat provider.

- Add `msgvault stage-delete <query>` or `msgvault stage-delete --ids 123,456,789`
  to stage active messages, with optional exact-source narrowing and `--dry-run`
  support for reviewing the match count first. The ID form uses the existing
  message-ID resolver directly, without search or waiting for analytical-cache
  readiness. A newly started local daemon may initialize its cache in the
  background for later query consumers.

- Starting in v0.20.0, remote deletion remains permanently opt-in. The
  invoking CLI can grant durable consent with
  `[deletion] remote_enabled = true`; `MSGVAULT_ENABLE_REMOTE_DELETE=1`
  remains a permanent one-command
  alternative, with no planned automatic removal of the guardrail. Invoking
  clients safely forward consent through local and remote daemon execution;
  daemon-host config and environment are not treated as client consent.

- Import Slackdump directories and ZIPs without a Slack token, preserving
  conversations, threads, reactions, identities, raw JSON, and exported files.

- Mailing-list traffic is indexed from RFC 2919 `List-Id` headers on new
  email and can be backfilled offline with `msgvault repair-list-ids` (dry run
  by default, `--apply` to write). `list:` and `list-id:` now work across
  local search backends, while the TUI and web analytical workspace expose a
  Lists grouping with exact case-insensitive drill-down.

- Native read-only Notion AI Meeting Notes sync, including sanitized access
  probing, changed-meeting refresh, verified attendee resolution, bounded late
  transcript retries, raw evidence, daemon scheduling, and Meetings TUI support.

- Exact source selection is available through `--source-id` on `sync`,
  `sync-full`, `update-account`, `remove-account`, and `delete-staged`.
  Account arguments continue to accept identifiers and display names, while
  destructive commands reject ambiguous tokens. Version-2 deletion manifests
  and staging responses preserve the source type and identifier so execution
  remains scoped when two source types share the same identifier.

- The MCP server answers "who is this", "when did we last talk", and "which
  network do I reach them on" for a durable person through one read-only
  `get_person_profile` tool. It returns the display name, tracking state,
  the deterministic contact state (first and last contact, last inbound and
  outbound, interaction count, inferred channel), the curated
  `primary_channel`, non-sensitive attributes, current employment, typed
  relationships, contact points, dates, and categories, all from local
  derived state. Sensitive attributes, private Notes, addresses, and media
  are excluded, and the tool makes no provider calls.

- Person profile catalog and tracking foundation: eleven reconciled system
  profile attributes (location, birthplace, membership, religion, politics,
  personality, pets, interests, favorites) with portable `is_sensitive`
  metadata, plus `msgvault person track|untrack` and
  `/api/v1/people/{id}/tracking` to opt a durable person into future profile
  maintenance.

- The seeded person catalog gains `how_we_met`, a single-value text field
  for how you and a person first met, and every seeded text field
  now accepts 280 characters instead of 120. Both changes apply on store open
  for SQLite and PostgreSQL alike: a fresh archive has the field before anyone
  types, an existing archive is widened in place, and tracked people pick up
  the changed target catalog on their next sweep.

- Scope embedding builds to selected accounts: `[vector.embed.scope] accounts`
  keeps the daemon's scheduled embeds within the listed accounts, and
  `msgvault embeddings build --account/--collection` overrides the account
  scope for a single run. The account scope is part of the generation
  fingerprint, so changing it requires a full rebuild; account-scoped indexes
  do not gate search — out-of-scope accounts simply rank on BM25 alone.
  Activation refuses a source scope that matches no live messages (an added
  but never-synced account) rather than replacing the serving index with an
  empty one, and the daemon marks vector search stale when the configured
  accounts resolve to a different source set than it was started with.

**Bug fixes**

- Deduplication now derives missing RFC822 Message-ID metadata only after the
  user confirms the reviewed plan, applies the exact derivation plan atomically,
  rescans, and refuses duplicate hiding when the actionable plan changes. Its
  CLI/daemon plan contract reports pending derivations explicitly and rejects
  incompatible peers instead of showing misleading consent text.
- Deduplication no longer derives metadata from malformed bracketed Message-IDs.
  When raw MIME is available, its recoverable Message-ID header must match the
  stored value before that message can join a Message-ID duplicate group. The
  importer preserves established conversation threading behavior. PostgreSQL
  reports derived IDs containing NUL bytes as failed candidates instead of
  approving a value that its text type cannot store.
- Remote deletion forwarding strips daemon-host opt-in state and accepts only
  authenticated invoking-client consent, preventing a server's configuration
  or environment from authorizing an unrelated client command.
- Everything and Files now page narrow analytical metadata before enriching
  participant details, preventing default listings on multi-million-message
  archives from exhausting the interactive DuckDB memory budget.
- WhatsApp vCard imports skip phone values without explicit international `+`
  or `00` provenance.

---

## 0.19.0
<small>2026-08-07</small>

**New features**

- A new relationships-focused Web UI explores a mixed archive as messages,
  conversations, files, people, and domains. It adds explicit full-text,
  semantic, and hybrid search states; Saved Views; source status; safe deletion
  staging; settings; keyboard navigation; and authenticated remote sessions.
- Slack workspace archiving imports the channels a user belongs to, group DMs,
  direct messages, threads, reactions, mentions, and files through a read-only
  user token. Incremental sync discovers late replies to threads of any age,
  and `backfill-slack-media` retries deferred downloads.
- Discord guild archiving imports bot-visible channels, threads, forum posts,
  edits, deletion state, reaction summaries, and attachments with resumable
  per-container checkpoints. `sync-discord`, bounded compatibility and generic
  exports, scheduled sync, and `backfill-discord-media` cover ongoing archive
  maintenance; personal DMs and user-token automation are intentionally out of
  scope.
- `POST /api/v1/import/meeting` accepts one provider-neutral meeting at a time,
  stores it as a searchable meeting transcript, and updates repeated deliveries
  in place by source identifier and external meeting ID.
- `list-folders` shows selectable IMAP folders and approximate counts.
  Repeatable `--folder` and `--skip-folder` flags on `sync-full` and `sync`
  safely restrict a scan without removing messages or labels learned earlier.
- `export-messages` streams required, bounded time windows as deterministic,
  provider-neutral `msgvault-message-export/1` JSON Lines. A completion trailer
  lets consumers reject interrupted output, and exact source and message-type
  filters keep large mixed archives bounded.
- `GET /api/v1/messages/changes` provides current message snapshots ordered by
  a content-change watermark, with opaque archive-bound cursors and a safe
  completion bound. It is an invalidation feed, not an audit log: multiple
  edits may collapse into one row, and related-table-only changes are outside
  its contract.
- Email sync now enriches already-confirmed source-scoped identities with
  strong evidence from trusted Sent metadata; first-time aliases require
  `identity discover --apply`. `identity discover` previews archived and
  optional Fastmail alias evidence, while `identity import` previews or applies
  text and JSON lists with unambiguous numeric source selection.
- Durable person profiles provide stable IDs, vCard UIDs, explicit participant
  bindings, display-name overrides, and optimistic concurrency. Typed,
  historized person attributes and portable metadata-defined fields are
  available through the CLI, HTTP API, and generated clients. Together with
  the meeting, change-feed, and source-identity additions, these changes
  advance the OpenAPI schema to 1.36.0.
- MCP Streamable HTTP can reuse `[server].api_key` for bearer authentication.
  Authenticated listeners may bind beyond loopback without the insecure
  override, while keyless non-loopback listeners still require an explicit
  `--http-allow-insecure` opt-in.
- The vCard codec now parses, validates, and deterministically renders vCard
  2.1, 3.0, and 4.0 while preserving ordered properties, groups, parameters,
  unknown extensions, legacy encodings, and source spelling. Its IANA registry
  snapshot and coverage declarations are vendored and checkable.
- `[data].loose_attachments = true` keeps newly stored attachments as individual
  files, disables automatic and explicit pack/repack creation, and makes backup
  restore materialize loose files. Existing packs remain readable until the
  operator stops the daemon and runs `unpack-attachments` once.

**Improvements**

- Relationship activity, people, domains, and daily signals now use compact
  Parquet indexes. The Relationships workspace and person/domain/file grouping
  stay within the daemon's interactive memory budget on multi-million-message
  archives; upgrading an existing SQLite cache triggers one full rebuild.
- Email ingestion rejects missing, malformed, and implausible canonical dates
  outside 1990 through 30 days in the future, then falls back through the oldest
  plausible `Received` timestamp and source metadata. `repair-dates` previews
  the same rules and `--apply` records an audit ledger before refreshing the
  analytics cache.
- The official Docker image now includes the SQLite vector extension, so
  SQLite-backed semantic and hybrid search can be enabled without rebuilding
  the container.
- `[microsoft].redirect_uri` can override the Microsoft 365 and Teams OAuth
  callback when the application registration requires a custom URI.
- The repeatable IMAP sync flags are now singular: `--folder` and
  `--skip-folder`.
- Background lifecycle management is standardized under `msgvault daemon`
  with `start`, `status`, `stop`, and `restart`; `msgvault serve` is the
  foreground Web UI/API and scheduler. The old `serve` lifecycle forms remain
  hidden compatibility aliases.
- Analytics cache builds stage and verify every dataset before publishing it
  under one lock, with `_last_sync.json` written last as the commit marker.
  Failed exports retain the previous committed cache, while interrupted
  publication is rejected and repaired instead of exposing mixed Parquet data.
- Newly generated NAS Compose bundles use `pull_policy: always` for the moving
  GHCR `latest` tag. A restart still reuses the installed image; reconcile with
  `docker compose up -d` or explicitly pull before restarting older bundles.

**Bug fixes**

- `add-beeper` now registers networks Beeper Desktop serves natively rather
  than through a bridge, such as iMessage. Beeper omits those accounts from its
  accounts API, so they are found from chat data instead and then sync, resume,
  and filter like any other Beeper source. Re-run `add-beeper` on an existing
  install to pick them up.
- Daemon-backed CLI, TUI, MCP, statistics, and backup operations now wait for
  completion or caller cancellation instead of failing at fixed HTTP or server
  deadlines on slow storage. Local daemon authentication uses the lightweight
  authenticated health endpoint, while connection setup, browser traffic, and
  ordinary API clients retain protective timeouts.
- Daemon runtime-record cleanup now requires a probe-confirmed identity
  mismatch before deletion, tolerates small creation-time clock skew, and lets
  a live daemon republish a missing record. This prevents false local-writer
  conflicts during later operations such as backup.
- Full message detail, including MCP `get_message`, restores chat senders from
  `messages.sender_id` when a direct message has no explicit `from` recipient
  row. Explicit email sender rows remain authoritative.
- MBOX imports recover dates whose header value gained a trailing continuation
  artifact and accept weekday plus US month-day ordering.
- `deduplicate --content-hash` batches RFC822 duplicate-group reads and uses a
  supporting index instead of issuing one unindexed query per group, avoiding
  planning timeouts on large archives.
- Generic and Discord compatibility exports use stable keyset reads, the same
  sender precedence as message APIs, and outer source constraints when scanning
  conversations, avoiding rescans, skipped rows, and unrelated archive work.
- Repeated source-deletion observations preserve the original tombstone time
  and no longer bump a message's content-change watermark until its state
  actually changes.
- Canceled maintenance transactions preserve the caller's cancellation error
  when `database/sql` has already rolled the transaction back, without masking
  substantive commit failures.
- Granola accepts exact date-only values for note, calendar, and transcript
  timestamps and normalizes them to midnight UTC instead of dropping the note.

## 0.18.0
<small>2026-07-14</small>

**New features**

- Granola and Circleback meeting notes, summaries, action items, and
  transcripts can be synced into the archive and browsed in a new read-only
  Meetings mode in the TUI. Meeting records are searchable with
  `message_type:meeting_transcript`, and scheduled sync is supported through
  `[[granola]]` and `[[circleback]]` configuration.
- Beeper Desktop chat archiving registers each bridged network as a separate
  source, incrementally syncs messages, reactions, edits, and deletions, and
  downloads media into the attachment store. Interrupted history backfills
  resume, and `backfill-beeper-media` retries pending downloads.
- `msgvault skills install` installs bundled read-only agent skills for search,
  attachment, and analytics workflows into Claude Code and Codex;
  `msgvault skills uninstall` removes generated copies.
- MCP search now has explicit `search_metadata`, `search_message_bodies`, and
  `semantic_search_messages` tools. `search_in_message` finds literal matches
  with raw-body offsets inside one message. The former combined
  `search_messages` tool remains as a deprecated compatibility wrapper.
- MCP `list_messages` accepts a `conversation_id` filter for listing one
  conversation or thread.
- The daemon HTTP API schema is now 1.3.0 and supports `scope=body` on deep
  search so daemon-backed clients can require an exact body-only response;
  bounded excerpts are returned in an ID-keyed `body_contexts` companion.
- `GET /api/v1/attachments/{hash}/content` streams archived attachment bytes
  by SHA-256 content hash; message details expose the hash needed to call it.
- Windows users can build natively with `scripts/build.ps1` on AMD64 or ARM64.
  Releases now include a native Windows ARM64 package with DuckDB analytics and
  Parquet cache support.

**Improvements**

- Attachment storage now supports sealed, immutable content-addressed packs
  while remaining compatible with loose files. `pack-attachments` migrates
  eligible loose content, `repack-attachments` reclaims dead pack space, and
  `unpack-attachments` restores loose files for downgrade or recovery.
- Backup snapshots now use Kit's pack-based backup engine. Restore installs
  compatible attachment packs directly by default, still SHA-256 verifies
  every selected attachment, and falls back to loose files for incompatible or
  oversized content; `--loose-attachments` forces loose restoration.
- Attachment exports, backup capture, HTTP downloads, and other consumers
  stream packed or loose content instead of buffering whole attachments in
  memory.
- SQLite's full `PRAGMA integrity_check` is now opt-in during restore through
  `--integrity-check`; page hashes, content hashes, and manifest-statistics
  verification remain enabled for every restore.
- Apple Mail import recognizes `.partial.emlx` files whose bodies are present
  but attachments have not been cached. A complete `N.emlx` copy takes
  precedence over `N.partial.emlx` when both exist.
- PostgreSQL full-text indexes use a versioned field layout so stale indexes
  are detected and must be backfilled before body-only search.

**Bug fixes**

- IMAP folder `UIDVALIDITY` / `UIDNEXT` high water marks are now supported on
  servers that advertise an `\All` mailbox and are persisted as each folder is
  safely ingested. Interrupted, limited, or partially failed folders do not
  advance, so later fast syncs can skip unchanged folders without missing mail.
- Local daemon discovery works when the msgvault home or configured data
  directory is a symlink, restoring the path layouts supported before 0.17.0
  while retaining ownership and permission checks on the resolved directory.
- Metadata-only and body-only search scopes are enforced consistently across
  SQLite, PostgreSQL, DuckDB, and daemon-backed MCP sessions. Counts and
  aggregate statistics use the same predicates, and body excerpts remain
  bounded and UTF-8-safe.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for the Kit backup and
  packed-attachment storage work, agent skills, Apple Mail partial-message
  import, native Windows builds and ARM64 releases, and symlink-safe daemon
  discovery.
- Thanks to [endolith](https://github.com/endolith) for the MCP search tools,
  in-message search, and consistent metadata/body search scopes.

  by content hash through the HTTP API and generated Go client.
- Thanks to [Matthew Sweeney](https://github.com/sweenzor) for Beeper Desktop
  archiving and Granola/Circleback meeting sync and TUI browsing.
- Thanks to [Jesse Vincent](https://github.com/obra) for correct IMAP folder
  high water marks and fast sync on servers with an `\All` mailbox.

## 0.17.1
<small>2026-07-06</small>

**New features**

- Deletion staging endpoints on the HTTP API (schema 1.2.0):
  `POST /api/v1/deletions` stages messages by filter and/or message IDs with
  server-side Gmail-ID resolution and a `dry_run` preview,
  `GET /api/v1/deletions` lists staged manifests by status, and
  `DELETE /api/v1/deletions/{id}` cancels a pending or in-progress manifest.
  Execution still happens only through `delete-staged`.
- The generated Go client includes deletion staging support through
  `StageDeletion`, including both dry-run (`200`) and create (`201`)
  responses.
- `msgvault search` now reports full-text index readiness while the daemon is
  checking or rebuilding the CLI search index, with long-running searches
  showing the daemon activity they are waiting on.

**Improvements**

- CLI search no longer waits for the full-text index completeness probe or
  backfill before returning results. Index checks and backfills run in the
  background, and responses identify when results may be incomplete until the
  index catches up.
- SQLite archives now index deletion timestamps so daemon cold starts avoid
  full-table deletion checks while deciding whether the analytics cache is
  stale.
- Automated dependency updates now use Renovate, and project dependencies were
  refreshed.

**Bug fixes**

- IMAP UID enumeration now constrains searches to fetchable UID ranges and
  raw fetches no longer depend on fragile `ENVELOPE` parsing, improving
  robustness on servers such as iCloud IMAP.
- API-staged deletion manifests now reject empty or unknown filter input,
  enforce single-account selections, record the raw staging request, and avoid
  same-second manifest ID collisions.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for the deletion staging
  API and client support, non-blocking CLI search status reporting, deletion
  timestamp indexes, and dependency refresh.
- Thanks to [Tim Kersten](https://github.com/io41) for the IMAP UID
  enumeration and raw-fetch robustness fixes.
- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for
  migrating automated dependency updates to Renovate.

## 0.17.0
<small>2026-07-04</small>

**New features**

- `msgvault backup` adds incremental, verifiable archive snapshots with
  `init`, `create`, `list`, `verify`, and `restore`. Snapshots capture the
  SQLite database, attachments, deletion audit files, and optional config/token
  extras into an append-only repository with byte-level verification.
- Google Calendar archive support via `msgvault add-calendar` and
  `msgvault sync-calendar`, including read-only event sync, recurring series,
  cancellations, scheduled `[[gcal]]` sync, and search with
  `--message-type calendar_event`.
- Microsoft Teams archive support via delegated Microsoft Graph sync.
  `msgvault add-teams` authorizes Graph access, `msgvault sync-teams` imports
  chats and channels, Teams messages are stored with `message_type = teams`,
  and `backfill-teams-media` can re-fetch hosted inline media for already
  imported messages.
- Search and query paths now understand message-type scoping. Local search
  accepts `message_type:` / `message_type=` query operators and the
  `--message-type` flag; HTTP, MCP, aggregate, and SQL-backed query surfaces
  expose the stored `message_type` so email, calendar events, text messages,
  Teams messages, and other imported records can be separated cleanly.
- Scoped embedding builds can restrict a vector generation to selected message
  types through `[vector.embed.scope].message_types`, with vector/hybrid search
  rejecting incompatible unscoped queries instead of treating a partial index as
  complete.
- The HTTP API is now generated through Huma with a checked-in OpenAPI contract
  (`msgvault openapi`, `/openapi.json`) and a generated Go client under
  `pkg/client`.
- Archive-access CLI commands now route through a msgvault daemon (the
  configured remote server, or a local background daemon that starts on
  demand and idles out after `[server].daemon_idle_timeout`). The daemon is
  the single archive writer: concurrent operations queue with a visible
  `Waiting:` message, read-only commands run immediately, and scheduled
  syncs yield to interactive commands. See the
  [Daemon Migration Guide](/docs/guides/daemon-migration/).
- Daemon lifecycle management via `msgvault serve start|status|stop|restart`,
  with automatic restart of older local daemons on binary upgrade
  (`[server].daemon_auto_restart`).

**Improvements**

- IMAP resyncs skip unchanged folders using the mailbox `UIDVALIDITY` and
  `UIDNEXT` values captured after the previous completed sync.
- `msgvault serve stop` now explains long shutdown waits by reporting the
  daemon operation it is waiting for and periodically printing elapsed wait
  updates.
- MCP `get_message` returns large message bodies in windows instead of
  returning the whole body in one response.
- Vector embedding maintenance no longer uses a separate pending queue.
  Coverage is tracked per message with `embed_gen`, so rebuilds, repairs, and
  daemon top-ups all share the same scan-and-fill path.
- Full-sync batch errors are counted and persisted on the sync run, making
  source status and diagnostics more accurate after partial failures.
- The documentation site now lives in the repository, including CLI, API,
  setup, backup, calendar, daemon, PostgreSQL, and vector-search docs plus the
  docs build/check scripts.
- macOS users can install through Homebrew with `brew install msgvault`.
- The TUI migration to Bubble Tea v2 is complete.

**Deprecations**

- `tui --force-sql`, `tui --no-cache-build`, `tui --no-sqlite-scanner`,
  `mcp --force-sql`, and `mcp --no-sqlite-scanner` are deprecated (removal
  planned for a later release); engine and cache selection moved to the
  `[analytics]` config section.

**Bug fixes**

- MCP list/search requests now reject Gmail-only `list:` / `List-ID` search
  operators instead of treating them as local full-text terms.
- DuckDB query engines re-probe Parquet schema columns when the cache is
  rebuilt or replaced underneath a running process.
- Empty `subject:` and empty text search terms no longer match every message.
- Facebook Messenger imports preserve multiple attachments on one message
  instead of collapsing them into a single row.
- Imported message and reaction timestamps are normalized to UTC.
- TUI startup avoids mixed SQLite access while the daemon owns archive writes.
- API server documentation no longer overflows its sidebar on narrow layouts.
- Release publishing and the Nix update flow were corrected for the new module
  and release packaging.

## 0.15.0
<small>2026-05-28</small>

**New features**

- Microsoft Outlook PST archive import via `msgvault import-pst`, including folder labels, attachments, resumable checkpoints, and automatic skipping of non-email PST items.
- Facebook Messenger Download Your Information import via `msgvault import-messenger`, with JSON and HTML export support.
- SyncTech SMS Backup & Restore import via `msgvault import-synctech-sms`, plus Google Drive source configuration and one-shot sync commands for scheduled Android backups.
- Per-account identities, named collections, scoped search/stats, and reversible deduplication workflows across accounts and collections.
- Google service account support for Workspace domain-wide delegation, including per-app service account keys.
- Message detail API responses now expose `body_html`, and inline image MIME parts can be fetched through a dedicated inline endpoint.
- MCP StreamableHTTP transport with `msgvault mcp --http`.
- MCP `search_by_domains` tool for finding messages where any participant belongs to one of several domains.

**Improvements**

- Vector embedding management is consolidated under a single `msgvault embeddings` command, with `build`, `resume`, `list`, `activate`, and `retire` subcommands covering the full index-generation lifecycle. `msgvault build-embeddings` still works as a deprecated alias for `msgvault embeddings build`.
- Long messages are split into embedding chunks instead of being truncated to a single input.
- Embedding preprocessing now handles HTML bodies, base64/data blobs, URL tracking parameters, and whitespace cleanup more aggressively.
- Embedding progress reporting has steadier ETA handling, per-character timing, and better behavior when failed batches are downshifted.
- SQLite full-text search ranking better matches the weighting used by PostgreSQL-backed paths.
- iMessage imports can backfill participant display names from vCard contacts.
- Scheduled sync dispatch now resolves source type and supports IMAP sources as well as Gmail. `msgvault serve` can also schedule SyncTech SMS Backup & Restore Drive sources.
- SQLite sync paths are more durable and treat transient network failures as retryable scheduled-sync skips.
- Routine CLI command errors no longer print the full help output.
- Update checks avoid unnecessary GitHub API rate-limit pressure.
- Switch the Go module path to `go.kenn.io/msgvault`.

**Bug fixes**

- Domain-based search results now hide locally deleted rows.
- SQL slow/error logging includes query arguments and reports accurate streaming query durations.
- Embedding skips rows that become empty after preprocessing and surfaces API 4xx response bodies for easier troubleshooting.
- PST imports namespace source message IDs per archive so messages from different PST files no longer collide.

## 0.14
<small>2026-04-21</small>

**New features**

- **Vector search (semantic and hybrid).** msgvault can now embed your archive using a configured OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint (Ollama, llama.cpp `server`, LM Studio, etc.) and search it by meaning, not just keywords. `msgvault search --mode vector` runs pure semantic search; `--mode hybrid` fuses BM25 and vector similarity via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Exposed through local CLI search (`msgvault search`), the HTTP API (`GET /api/v1/search?mode=vector|hybrid`), and the MCP server (`search_messages` mode argument plus a new `find_similar_messages` tool). See [Vector Search](/docs/usage/vector-search/).
- `msgvault build-embeddings` command to generate and maintain the local vector index. Incremental by default; `--full-rebuild` creates a new generation and atomically activates it once coverage reaches zero. Same-model rebuilds keep answering against the previous active generation while the new one is built, with active-generation top-ups frozen until activation; model or dimension changes return `index_stale` until activation.
- Background embedding via the daemon scheduler. A new `[vector.embed.schedule]` config block drives the embed worker on cron and/or after every successful scheduled sync, so `msgvault serve` can keep the vector index current without manual intervention.
- `/api/v1/stats` gains a `vector_search` sub-object reporting the active generation, any in-flight rebuild, and the actionable missing embedding count for the generation the worker will target next.
- `msgvault rebuild-fts` command to rebuild the SQLite FTS5 shadow table after corruption.

**Improvements**

- `search` command gains `--mode fts|vector|hybrid` and `--explain` flags. `--explain` includes per-signal scores (RRF, BM25, vector) in table and JSON output for ranking inspection.
- Configuration gains a full `[vector]` block with sub-tables for the embedding endpoint, message preprocessing, hybrid ranking, and the embed scheduler. See [Configuration: vector](/docs/configuration/#vector).
- `remove-account` deletes attachment files from disk when they were unique to the removed account. Files shared across multiple accounts are preserved automatically, and an in-progress sync on any account skips file deletion to avoid racing new attachment writes.

**Bug fixes**

- `remove-account` no longer leaves orphaned attachment files on disk after an account's database rows are removed.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Yuriy Grinberg](https://github.com/webgress) for the first PostgreSQL dialect refactor, which laid groundwork for alternative storage backends.
- Thanks to [Matthew C Roberts](https://github.com/YourEconProf) for making `remove-account` clean up unshared attachment files safely.
- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for semantic and hybrid vector search, the embedding-generation workflow, background embedding scheduler, and the FTS5 rebuild recovery command.

## 0.13.1
<small>2026-04-15</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Fix importing older WhatsApp `msgstore.db` backups.

---

## 0.13
<small>2026-04-14</small>

**New features**

- Structured file logging with per-run correlation IDs. Every CLI invocation gets a unique `run_id` on every log line, making it easy to trace a single run across shared log files. New `msgvault logs` command for viewing and tailing logs. File logging is opt-in; see [Configuration: Log](/docs/configuration/#log) for setup.

**Improvements**

- The terminal UI inherits your terminal background colors instead of forcing its own, so custom terminal themes (Dracula, Solarized, Nord, etc.) work naturally.

**Bug fixes**

- Improve full-text search performance across local archives.
- Improve terminal UI stability during rapid interactions (fix race condition where switching views could briefly show stale data).

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Jesse Robbins](https://github.com/jesserobbins) for structured file logging with per-run correlation IDs, plus the full-text search performance fix and TUI race-condition fix.
- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for making the TUI inherit terminal background colors.

---

## 0.12.1
<small>2026-04-10</small>

**New features**

- Shell completion via `msgvault completion` for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell.
- `MSGVAULT_IMAP_PASSWORD` environment variable and stdin piping for non-interactive `add-imap` (Docker, CI).
- Advanced search: word-boundary regex matching replaces ILIKE substring matching across all search paths, and FTS5 prefix search for the SQLite full-text index.
- Expanded store API with structured query parsing for search (`SearchMessagesQuery`).

**Improvements**

- Search result quality: text matching switched from ILIKE to word-boundary regex, reducing false positives from substring matches. SQLite aggregate sort ties are broken deterministically by key.
- Nix flake packaging metadata updated for 0.12.1.
- Docker image switched to `wolfi-base` with `libstdc++` for CGO/DuckDB compatibility, non-root user, and health check.

**Bug fixes**

- IMAP label handling: standard folders (Sent, Drafts, Trash, Junk, etc.) are now classified as system labels via RFC 6154 attributes and fallback name matching.
- `import-mbox` accepts plain mbox files with any extension (ZIP entries still require `.mbox`/`.mbx`), `--label` is repeatable/comma-separated, and re-imports update labels on existing messages instead of silently skipping.
- API search now uses the full structured query parser (operators like `from:`, `subject:`, date/size filters) instead of plain-text matching.
- `completion` command registered correctly in the CLI command tree.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Jesse Robbins](https://github.com/jesserobbins) for the advanced search work across regex matching, FTS5 prefix search, snippets, deterministic sorting, and related search-quality improvements.
- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for the completion-command registration fix, IMAP label handling fixes, MBOX import fixes, API structured-query search fix, and Docker image update.

## 0.12
<small>2026-04-09</small>

**New features**

- SQL query interface via `msgvault query`. Run arbitrary SQL against DuckDB over Parquet with `--format json|csv|table`. See [SQL Queries](/docs/usage/querying/).
- Microsoft 365 OAuth2 support via `msgvault add-o365` for Outlook.com and organizational accounts. Auto-detects personal vs. org IMAP hosts.
- Text message import: `import-whatsapp`, `import-imessage`, and `import-gvoice` for WhatsApp, iMessage, and Google Voice. See [Text Messages](/docs/usage/text-messages/).
- TUI text mode: press `m` to toggle between Email and Texts for browsing imported text conversations.
- `--after` and `--before` date filters for `sync-full` with IMAP accounts.
- CC and BCC recipients exposed in the message API responses.
- Claude Code skill for querying the archive via SQL views.

**Improvements**

- `delete-staged` now supports IMAP accounts (uses `UID STORE \Deleted` + `UID EXPUNGE`).
- Analytics cache is automatically rebuilt after write operations (sync, import, delete-staged) so stats stay current.
- `msgvault query` auto-rebuilds a stale cache before executing SQL.
- Improved archive query views and text-message search support.

**Bug fixes**

- `from:domain.com` search now matches domain patterns automatically for common TLDs. Uncommon TLDs still require the explicit `@` prefix (`from:@brand.pizza`).
- Wait for the IMAP server greeting before authenticating, fixing `unexpected EOF` errors with OAuth proxies.
- Fix label name conflict handling when ensuring Gmail labels (use `ON CONFLICT` upsert).
- Open the MCP database in read-only mode to prevent concurrent session hangs when multiple AI sessions query the archive.
