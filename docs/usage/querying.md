description: Run arbitrary SQL against your archived email using DuckDB.
---

The `msgvault query` command lets you run SQL directly against your archive's Parquet analytics cache using an in-memory DuckDB engine. This gives you full SQL expressiveness for ad-hoc analysis, custom reports, and data exploration beyond what the built-in analytics commands provide.

## Basic Usage

```bash
msgvault query "SELECT count(*) AS total FROM messages"
```

The command takes a single argument: the SQL string. If the analytics cache is stale, it is automatically rebuilt before the query runs (progress is printed to stderr).

## Output Formats

Control output format with the `--format` flag:

```bash
# JSON (default)
msgvault query "SELECT count(*) AS total FROM messages"

# CSV
msgvault query --format csv "SELECT from_email, message_count FROM v_senders LIMIT 5"

# Aligned text table
msgvault query --format table "SELECT from_email, message_count FROM v_senders LIMIT 5"
```

| Format | Description |
|---|---|
| `json` | JSON object with `columns`, `rows`, and `row_count` fields (default) |
| `csv` | Standard CSV with a header row |
| `table` | Aligned text table with separator line and `(N rows)` footer |

## Available Views

### Base views

These map directly to the Parquet files in `~/.msgvault/analytics/`.

| View | Key Columns |
|---|---|
| `messages` | id, source_id, source_message_id, conversation_id, subject, snippet, sent_at, size_estimate, has_attachments, attachment_count, sender_id, message_type, year, month, deleted_from_source_at |
| `participants` | id, email_address, domain, display_name, phone_number |
| `message_recipients` | message_id, participant_id, recipient_type (from/to/cc/bcc), display_name, email_address, envelope_address |
| `labels` | id, name |
| `message_labels` | message_id, label_id |
| `attachments` | message_id, filename, size |
| `conversations` | id, source_conversation_id, title, conversation_type |
| `sources` | id, source_type |

`message_recipients.email_address` is the recipient's address: the address
written in the message header when one was recorded, otherwise the
participant's current address. It is NULL only for participants without an
email address, such as phone-number contacts. `envelope_address` is the header
address exactly as written and is NULL when none was recorded, which covers
chat and calendar rows and mail imported before v0.19.0.

### Convenience views

Pre-joined and aggregated views for common queries.

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| `v_messages` | Messages with resolved sender (from_email, from_name, from_domain, from_phone) and labels as a JSON array |
| `v_senders` | Per-sender aggregates: from_email, from_name, from_domain, message_count, total_size, attachment_size, attachment_count, first_message_at, last_message_at |
| `v_domains` | Per-domain aggregates: domain, message_count, total_size, sender_count |
| `v_labels` | Per-label: name, message_count, total_size |
| `v_threads` | Per-conversation: conversation_id, source_conversation_id, conversation_title, conversation_type, message_count, first_message_at, last_message_at, participant_emails (JSON array) |

## Example Queries

### Top senders by message count

```bash
msgvault query "
  SELECT from_email, from_name, message_count, total_size
  FROM v_senders
  ORDER BY message_count DESC
  LIMIT 20
"
```

### Domain breakdown

```bash
msgvault query "
  SELECT domain, message_count, sender_count,
         total_size / (1024*1024) AS size_mb
  FROM v_domains
  ORDER BY message_count DESC
  LIMIT 20
"
```

### Messages per month for a given year

```bash
msgvault query "
  SELECT month, count(*) AS messages
  FROM messages
  WHERE year = 2024
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY month
"
```

### Filter by message type

Mixed archives store email, calendar events, Teams and Discord messages, and
text-message imports in the same `messages` table. Use the `message_type`
column to keep SQL reports scoped:

```bash
# Teams activity by month
msgvault query --format table "
  SELECT month, count(*) AS messages
  FROM messages
  WHERE message_type = 'teams'
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY month DESC
  LIMIT 12
"

# Recent calendar records in the archive
msgvault query --format table "
  SELECT sent_at, subject, from_email
  FROM v_messages
  WHERE message_type = 'calendar_event'
  ORDER BY sent_at DESC
  LIMIT 20
"

# Discord activity by channel or thread
msgvault query --format table "
  SELECT t.conversation_title, count(*) AS messages
  FROM v_threads t
  JOIN messages m ON m.conversation_id = t.conversation_id
  WHERE m.message_type = 'discord'
  GROUP BY t.conversation_id, t.conversation_title
  ORDER BY messages DESC
  LIMIT 20
"
```

Known values are `email`, `calendar_event`, `meeting_transcript`, `beeper`,
`teams`, `discord`, `sms`, `mms`, `whatsapp`, `imessage`, `fbmessenger`,
`synctech_sms_call`, `google_voice_text`, `google_voice_call`, and
`google_voice_voicemail`.

### Label statistics

```bash
msgvault query "
  SELECT name, message_count, total_size / (1024*1024) AS size_mb
  FROM v_labels
  ORDER BY message_count DESC
"
```

### Largest attachments

```bash
msgvault query --format table "
  SELECT a.filename, a.size / (1024*1024) AS size_mb,
         m.subject, m.sent_at
  FROM attachments a
  JOIN messages m ON a.message_id = m.id
  ORDER BY a.size DESC
  LIMIT 20
"
```

### Thread activity

```bash
msgvault query "
  SELECT conversation_title, message_count,
         first_message_at, last_message_at
  FROM v_threads
  ORDER BY message_count DESC
  LIMIT 10
"
```

### Filter by label

The `labels` column in `v_messages` is a JSON array string. Use DuckDB's `list_contains` to filter:

```bash
msgvault query "
  SELECT subject, from_email, sent_at
  FROM v_messages
  WHERE list_contains(labels::VARCHAR[], 'INBOX')
  ORDER BY sent_at DESC
  LIMIT 20
"
```

Or join through the base tables for more control:

```bash
msgvault query "
  SELECT m.subject, m.sent_at
  FROM messages m
  JOIN message_labels ml ON m.id = ml.message_id
  JOIN labels l ON ml.label_id = l.id
  WHERE l.name = 'INBOX'
  ORDER BY m.sent_at DESC
  LIMIT 20
"
```

## Tips

**Partition pruning.** The `messages` view is hive-partitioned by year. Adding `WHERE year = 2024` to queries on `messages` lets DuckDB skip irrelevant Parquet files, which speeds up queries on large archives.

**Auto-cache rebuild.** If the analytics cache is stale or missing, `msgvault query` rebuilds it automatically before running your SQL. The rebuild progress prints to stderr, so it does not interfere with piping query output.

**Pipe-friendly.** JSON and CSV output modes are designed for piping into other tools (`jq`, `csvkit`, `xsv`, etc.). Use `--format csv` for spreadsheet workflows or `--format json` for programmatic consumption.

**Full DuckDB SQL.** You have access to DuckDB's full SQL dialect, including window functions, CTEs, `UNNEST`, `list_contains`, and all built-in functions. See the [DuckDB documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/introduction) for the full SQL reference.
