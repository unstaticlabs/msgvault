## Launch

```bash
msgvault tui
```

The TUI always talks to a msgvault HTTP server. Without `[remote].url`, it starts or reuses the local background daemon. The daemon owns database access, analytics engine selection, and cache rebuilds.

The daemon starts its HTTP health endpoint and API routes before analytics cache
maintenance. Clients can connect while startup work runs.

With `engine = "auto"` (the default), aggregate views initially use live SQL
(`sql-fallback`). When `auto_build_cache = true` and the cache is stale or
missing, the daemon builds it in the background; after the cache is ready and
DuckDB opens successfully, aggregate views switch to DuckDB. A failed build or
open leaves auto mode on live SQL. With `engine = "duckdb"`, analytics remain
unavailable until the required cache is ready; analytics routes return `503`
during initialization. `engine = "sql"` always uses live SQL. Configure engine
selection in `config.toml`:

```toml
[analytics]
engine = "auto"          # auto, sql, or duckdb
auto_build_cache = true  # build a stale/missing cache in the background at startup
```

Opening aggregate views does not trigger a build mid-session. Scheduled syncs
and ingest commands can refresh the cache, and `msgvault build-cache` builds or
repairs it on demand. Set `auto_build_cache = false` to skip automatic startup
maintenance; use `msgvault build-cache` for an explicit build. Deprecated in
0.17.0: the old `msgvault tui --force-sql`, `--no-cache-build`, and
`--no-sqlite-scanner` flags are hidden because these choices are now daemon
configuration. See [Configuration: analytics](/docs/configuration/#analytics).

### Local And Remote

When your `config.toml` has a `[remote]` section configured, the TUI connects to the remote server automatically. All views, drill-downs, search, and filtering work the same as local-daemon mode. Use `--local` only when you want to force this machine's local daemon instead of the configured remote server.

```bash
# Connects to remote server if [remote] is configured
msgvault tui

# Force this machine's local daemon
msgvault tui --local
```

Deletion staging and attachment export use the selected daemon. When connected to a configured remote server, staged deletion manifests are saved on that remote host; attachment export streams bytes from the daemon and writes the zip file on the CLI machine.

### Email Account and Collection Scopes

Press `A` in Email mode to choose `All Accounts`, an individual account, or a
named collection. A collection is a daemon-owned group of accounts, and the
title shows `Collection: <name>` while its exact member sources scope
aggregates, message lists, fast search, statistics, and deletion-target
inspection. An empty collection shows no results and makes no scoped HTTP read.

Collections require a daemon with API schema `2.17.0` or newer. Older or
unavailable daemons keep the account selector usable and hide collection rows.
Changing the Email scope returns to the top-level view and clears the current
search and selection. Texts and Meetings keep separate account or source
selectors; changing one mode's selection does not change another mode's scope.

Collections with multiple sources offer Fast search only. Deep search is
available for single-source collections; Semantic search requires an individual
account or All Accounts, subject to its other filter limits.

Deletion staging requires the selected messages to belong to one source.
You can stage messages from one source within a larger collection, but a
selection spanning sources is rejected. The TUI does not offer deduplication
operations; use the collection-scoped CLI commands for those.

Press `a` from any aggregate view to show all individual messages in that view. Press `Enter` on a message to view its full detail, including headers and body.

## View Modes

The TUI provides seven aggregate view modes. Press `g` to cycle through them:

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| Senders | Aggregate by sender email address |
| Sender Names | Aggregate by sender display name (falls back to email when no name is set) |
| Recipients | Aggregate by recipient email address |
| Recipient Names | Aggregate by recipient display name (falls back to email when no name is set) |
| Domains | Aggregate by sender domain |
| Labels | Aggregate by Gmail label |
| Time | Aggregate by time period (year/month/day) |
<figure class="screenshot" data-lightbox>

</figure>
### Time View

Press `t` from any view to jump directly to the Time view. The Time view aggregates messages by time period. When already in Time view, pressing `t` cycles between monthly, daily, and yearly granularity:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 0.5rem;">
  <figure style="margin: 0; text-align: center;" data-lightbox>
    <img src="/docs/assets/generated/tui-time-monthly.svg" alt="Time view: monthly granularity" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 4px;" />
    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.3rem;">Monthly</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure style="margin: 0; text-align: center;" data-lightbox>
    <img src="/docs/assets/generated/tui-time-daily.svg" alt="Time view: daily granularity" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 4px;" />
    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.3rem;">Daily</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure style="margin: 0; text-align: center;" data-lightbox>
    <img src="/docs/assets/generated/tui-time-yearly.svg" alt="Time view: yearly granularity" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 4px;" />
    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.3rem;">Yearly</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## Text Messages

Press `m` to cycle through Email, Texts, and Meetings. Texts is skipped when no
text/chat engine is available, but Meetings remains in the cycle even before a
meeting source has been configured. See [Text Messages](/docs/usage/text-messages/)
for local chat imports, [Microsoft Teams](/docs/usage/teams/) for Teams sync, and
[Discord](/docs/usage/discord/) for guild channel and thread sync.

Text mode provides the following view types. Press `g` to cycle through them:

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| Conversations | Aggregate by individual conversation |
| Contacts | Aggregate by contact phone number or identifier |
| Contact Names | Aggregate by contact display name (falls back to phone/ID when unavailable) |
| Sources | Aggregate by text service provider |
| Labels | Aggregate by custom labels or categories |
| Time | Aggregate by time period (year/month/day) |

Navigation and interaction in Text mode work the same as Email mode. Press `Enter` to drill into a conversation and view individual messages. Press `Esc` or `Backspace` to go back. Use `g` to re-aggregate from a drill-down view, `/` to search, and `f` to filter. The stats display shows message count and total size for text conversations.

## Meetings

Meetings mode is a read-only browser for transcripts and notes imported from
[Granola or Circleback](/docs/usage/meetings/). It shows a flat, newest-first list
with each meeting's date, title, organizer, and source. Press `Enter` to open
the transcript and notes, `Esc` or `Backspace` to return to the list, and the
left/right arrow keys to move between meeting details.

Press `/` in the meeting list to search titles, people, transcripts, and notes.
Meeting search is always scoped to meeting transcripts, including when the
search text contains explicit message-type syntax. In the detail view, `/`
finds text within the current transcript; use `n` and `N` to move between
matches.

Press `A` to select all meeting sources or one configured Granola or Circleback
source. This source choice is independent of the Email account filter. If an
older remote daemon does not provide source identity, the Source column shows
`—` instead of a misleading blank value.

Selection and deletion keys are disabled in Meetings mode. Meeting sync is
read-only, and browsing a transcript never changes the source service.

## Drill-down and Sub-grouping

Press `Enter` to drill into any row. For example, selecting a sender shows their individual messages. Press `Esc` or `Backspace` to go back.
<figure class="screenshot" data-lightbox>
  <img src="/docs/assets/generated/tui-drilldown.svg" alt="msgvault TUI drill-down showing messages from a specific sender" loading="lazy">
</figure>
From a drill-down view, press `g` to re-aggregate the filtered messages by a different dimension. You can think of this like an interactive pivot table. The cycle skips the dimension you drilled into — and when drilling from an email address view (Senders or Recipients), it also skips the corresponding name view since it would be redundant. For example, drilling into a sender and pressing `g` cycles through Recipients, Recipient Names, Domains, Labels, and Time.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 0.5rem;">
  <figure style="margin: 0; text-align: center;" data-lightbox>

  </figure>
  <figure style="margin: 0; text-align: center;" data-lightbox>

    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.3rem;">A sender's mail grouped by month</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## Searching

Press `/` to open a search bar that filters the current view in real time. Matching text is highlighted in the results. At the aggregate level (Senders, Domains, etc.), search uses the daemon's configured analytics engine, so the default local-daemon setup uses DuckDB over Parquet when the cache is usable.
<figure class="screenshot" data-lightbox>
  <img src="/docs/assets/generated/tui-search-sender.svg" alt="msgvault TUI search filtering senders by name with highlighted matches" loading="lazy">
</figure>
Search also works after drill-down. Drill into a result, then press `/` again to search within that context. This second-level search uses deep FTS5 full-text search over message subjects and bodies. You can progressively narrow results: find a sender, drill in, then search for a specific subject or keyword.

</figure>
</div>

## Filtering

Press `f` to open the filter modal. The modal presents two independent toggles that you can combine:

| Filter | Effect |
|---|---|
| Only with attachments | Show only messages that have attachments |
| Hide deleted from source | Exclude messages that have been deleted from Gmail |
<figure class="screenshot" data-lightbox>
  <img src="/docs/assets/generated/tui-filter-modal.svg" alt="msgvault TUI filter modal with checkbox toggles for attachments and hide deleted" loading="lazy">
</figure>
Use `↑`/`↓` to navigate, `Space` or `x` to toggle a filter, and `Enter` or `Esc` to apply and close. Active filters are shown in the title bar (e.g. `[Attachments]`, `[Hide Deleted]`). Filters apply to all views: aggregates, drill-downs, sub-aggregates, search results, and stats.

## Viewing Email Threads

From any message list (after drilling into a sender, label, domain, etc.), press `T` to open the full email thread for the highlighted message. This renders the complete conversation inline in the terminal, including sender, date, and body text for each message in the thread.
<figure class="screenshot" data-lightbox>

Press `Esc` to return to the message list.

## Marking Emails for Deletion

You can stage individual messages or bulk-delete entire aggregate groups (e.g. all emails from a sender, all messages with a given label) at once. Use `Space` to select one or more rows, then press `d` to stage them. From any aggregate view, press `D` to stage every message in the current group without selecting individual rows.
<figure class="screenshot" data-lightbox>
  <img src="/docs/assets/generated/tui-selection.svg" alt="msgvault TUI with rows selected for deletion staging" loading="lazy">
</figure>
A confirmation dialog shows exactly how many messages will be staged before anything happens. Messages are not deleted immediately; they are placed in a deletion batch that you review and execute separately with `msgvault delete-staged`.

## Performance

The default SQLite archive path uses DuckDB querying Parquet metadata exports for aggregate views. This architecture delivers aggregate queries (top senders, domains, labels, time series) **hundreds of times faster** than equivalent SQLite JOINs. The Parquet analytics layer has a small footprint, so drill-down and re-aggregation feel instant even on very large archives. Configure `[analytics].engine` if you need to force live SQL or require DuckDB.

See [Data Storage](/docs/architecture/storage/) for details on how this works.
