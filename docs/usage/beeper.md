title: Beeper
description: Archive every chat network connected to Beeper Desktop via its local API.
---

[Beeper Desktop](https://www.beeper.com) bridges many chat networks — WhatsApp,
Signal, Telegram, Instagram, LinkedIn, X, Facebook Messenger, iMessage, and
more — into one app. msgvault can archive all of them at once through Beeper
Desktop's local API. Each connected network account becomes its own msgvault
source, so a Signal thread and a Telegram thread stay separately filterable,
while all Beeper-archived messages share `message_type = beeper` for search.

Beeper sync is strictly read-only: msgvault only calls read endpoints of the
local API and never sends, edits, archives, or marks anything in Beeper.

## Prerequisites

- Beeper Desktop installed and running on the same machine as the msgvault
  daemon (the API listens on `localhost:23373` only).
- A Beeper Desktop access token: in Beeper Desktop open **Settings →
  Developer** and create an access token.

## Add Beeper

```bash
msgvault add-beeper
```

The command validates the token against the running Beeper Desktop, stores it
at `tokens/beeper.json` (0600), and registers one `beeper` source per
connected network account (e.g. `signal`, `telegram`, `whatsapp`,
`imessage_…`).

Beeper's accounts API omits some networks it serves natively rather than
bridging — currently iMessage — so those are found from chat data instead.
They are printed as *found via chats* and behave like any other `beeper`
source afterwards.

`add-beeper` is safe to re-run and does not disturb existing sources, so run it
again after connecting a new network in Beeper Desktop to register it.

Provide the token via the interactive prompt, `--token-file <path>`, or the
`MSGVAULT_BEEPER_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
MSGVAULT_BEEPER_TOKEN="..." msgvault add-beeper
msgvault add-beeper --token-file ~/beeper-token.txt
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--token-file` | Read the access token from a file |
| `--no-default-identity` | Do not auto-confirm each account's own identity (phone/email) as that source's "me" identity |

## Sync

```bash
# First run backfills all history; later runs are incremental.
msgvault sync-beeper

# Only specific networks.
msgvault sync-beeper --account signal --account telegram

# Repair path: re-fetch everything, upserting in place.
msgvault sync-beeper --full
```

The first sync walks every chat's full locally-available history. This is a
large one-time job for big archives (the API serves ~20 messages per request),
but it is fully resumable: interrupt it any time and the next run continues
from the saved checkpoint. Later runs only fetch chats with new activity.

Recent messages (last 24 hours) are re-checked on every incremental run so
edits, deletions, and reaction changes are captured; older in-place changes
are only picked up by `--full` runs.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--account` | all registered | Beeper accountID to sync (repeatable) |
| `--limit` | `0` | Max messages per chat this run (limited backfills resume next run) |
| `--full` | `false` | Ignore stored cursors and re-fetch every message (repairs rows in place) |
| `--no-media` | `false` | Skip attachment downloads for this run |

## What is archived

- Message text, sender, timestamps, and per-network conversation threads
  (groups keep their member lists and admin roles).
- Reactions, reply relationships, mentions, and edit/deletion markers —
  content that was archived before a deletion stays archived.
- Voice-note transcriptions (when Beeper has them) are appended to the message
  body so they are searchable.
- Attachments (photos, videos, voice notes, files) are downloaded during sync
  into msgvault's content-addressed attachment store. By default media from
  conversations with more than 20 participants is skipped with a typed
  `participant_threshold` marker, so direct chats and small groups keep their
  media while large rooms do not fill the disk; set
  `media_max_participants = 0` to collect from every room. Downloads that fail
  leave a pending marker and the message is archived anyway; retry them later
  with `msgvault backfill-beeper-media`. Over-cap files (`max_media_mb`) are
  recorded as a `size_cap` skip and retried only after the cap changes. Use
  `--no-media` or `media = false` to skip downloads — note that skipped-by-flag
  downloads leave no pending markers, so `backfill-beeper-media` will not fetch
  them later; re-enable media and run `sync-beeper --full` instead.
- The verbatim Beeper API JSON for every message (`raw_format = beeper_json`),
  so nothing is lost even where msgvault's relational model is narrower.

Because Beeper's API serves what Beeper Desktop has synced locally, archive
depth equals your local Beeper history: a freshly added Beeper account may only
have recent messages until Beeper finishes its own backfill. That backfill can
land hours or weeks later, behind history msgvault has already walked, so once a
day each sync re-checks the oldest end of every completed chat and resumes the
backfill wherever Beeper has since filled more in. Nothing is needed to trigger
this, and the run reports how many chats it reopened.

## Repairing derived data

Message bodies, snippets, the search index, and attachment classification are
derived from the API payload at import time, so improvements to how they are
derived do not reach messages already archived.

Nothing is needed to pick those up: each account re-derives itself once, on its
next sync, from the verbatim JSON stored with every message. The sync reports
how many rows it repaired. To repair on demand instead of waiting — or to finish
an interrupted pass — run it directly:

```bash
msgvault repair-derived --source-type beeper
msgvault repair-derived --source-type beeper --identifier instagramgo
```

It needs no Beeper Desktop connection, repairs messages Beeper no longer holds,
and rewrites only derived columns — raw payloads, downloaded media, and sync
cursors are untouched, so it is idempotent.

## Link previews

Media that arrives as a forwarded link preview — an Instagram reel, an x.com
post — is recorded with the URL it previews in `attachments.attachment_metadata`
(`{"shared_url": "..."}`). Voice note transcripts can also appear there under
`source_transcript`, so the shared URL field identifies previews. This tells a
photo a friend took apart from a public post they forwarded, which matters
because forwarded previews can dominate an Instagram archive's bytes while
remaining recoverable from the URL. Downloads are unaffected: everything is
still archived. The metadata copy of `source_transcript.text` is capped at 32
KiB on a UTF-8 boundary. A clipped value includes `"truncated": true`; the
field is omitted when the complete transcript fits. The full transcript stays
in the searchable message body. To see the split:

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN COALESCE(json_extract_string(a.attachment_metadata, '$.shared_url'), '') <> ''
            THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_share,
       COUNT(*), SUM(a.size)
FROM attachments a
JOIN messages m ON m.id = a.message_id
WHERE m.message_type = 'beeper'
GROUP BY is_share;
```

## Scheduled sync

Let the daemon run incremental syncs on a schedule:

```toml
[beeper]
enabled = true
schedule = "*/30 * * * *"
```

## Configuration

```toml
[beeper]
# url = "http://localhost:23373"   # Beeper Desktop API (default)
enabled = true                     # gate for the daemon schedule below
schedule = "*/30 * * * *"          # 5-field cron; empty = manual sync only
accounts = []                      # accountID include filter (empty = all)
exclude_accounts = []              # e.g. ["whatsapp"] — see below
rate_limit_qps = 20                # request rate against the local API
media = true                       # download attachment bytes
media_scope = "all"                # all, direct, or none
media_max_participants = 20        # skip media from larger rooms; 0 = no cap
max_media_mb = 250                 # per-attachment size cap

# [beeper.accounts_config.signal]   # per-account override, keyed by accountID
# media = true
# max_media_mb = 500
```

See [Media policy](/docs/configuration/#media-policy) for how the scope, participant
cap, size cap, and per-account overrides combine, and
`msgvault purge-excluded-media` for removing media a changed policy would no
longer collect.

### Overlap with native importers

If you already archive a network natively (e.g. `import-whatsapp` or
`import-imessage`), pick one path per network: msgvault does not deduplicate
messages across sources. Add the Beeper accountID to `exclude_accounts` to
keep Beeper sync away from that network. If both paths do run, the rows remain
separable (different sources and different `message_type` values), and
participants still unify across archives via phone-number and email matching
(the Beeper user ID is also persisted as an identifier, so later runs keep
resolving to the same person).

## Caveats

- **Reinstalling Beeper Desktop**: Beeper's message IDs are only stable per
  installation. msgvault verifies several anchor messages (across distinct
  chats) on every run; ordinary churn like deleting an anchored chat is
  tolerated, and only when no anchor survives are recently archived messages
  checked against the source. If the installation was rebuilt, the sync stops
  with an error; remove and re-add the Beeper sources in that case.
- **Remote daemons**: the Beeper API is loopback-only, so the msgvault daemon
  must run on the same machine as Beeper Desktop.
- **iMessage**: Beeper only carries iMessage on macOS, so archiving it this way
  needs a Mac running Beeper Desktop beside the msgvault daemon. Networks found
  from chat data are looked for in a bounded scan of your most recently active
  conversations, so one with no chats — or none recent enough to fall inside
  that window — stays invisible until it sees activity; send or receive a
  message, then re-run `add-beeper`. The scan logs a warning when it stops at
  its bound.
